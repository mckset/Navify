# Navify
A music streaming software for Linux that uses Spotify's recommendations and streams it from Youtube. Streamed songs are then cached on the users PC for future access. Keep in mind, when a new song is added, Navify uses the **First** video that shows up on youtube when you search for the song and the artist. You may receive videos unrelated to the songs or of bad quality if the song is obscure.

Requirements
------------
- MPV
- Youtube-dl
- Socat
- Spotify developer app - must be setup by the user (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/#:~:text=To%20do%20that%2C%20simply%20sign%20up%20at%20www.spotify.com.,complete%20your%20account%20set%20up.%20Register%20Your%20Application)

```

Usage

- The pencil edits a song (both cached and local)
- The 'N' button searches for recommended songs
- The  '...' opens the settings

Notes
-----
Navify creates and looks for files from the directory it is accessed from. If the program is accessed from a different folder than where the program is located, it will create and expect files like the 'icons' folder to be in that location. 

Potential Updates
-----------------
- Ability to change fonts and font sizes
- Ability to change the location for browsing local music files
- Support to stream from Spotify
- Windows support
- Local search
- More settings

Known Issues
------------
- The main window freezes when a subwindow is opened, but continues when the window is closed
- If the theme is changed while the player is searching for recommended songs, the recommended button can be pressed again and will override the first search request
