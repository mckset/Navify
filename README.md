# Navify
A music streaming software for Linux that uses Spotify's recommendations and streams it from Youtube. Streamed songs are then cached on the users PC for future access. Keep in mind, when a new song is added, Navify uses the **First** video that shows up on youtube when you search for the song and the artist. You may receive videos unrelated to the songs or of bad quality if they show up first.

Installation
------------
Navify requires that you setup a spotify developer app as show here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/#:~:text=To%20do%20that%2C%20simply%20sign%20up%20at%20www.spotify.com.,complete%20your%20account%20set%20up.%20Register%20Your%20Application. Once that is setup, all you have to do is run navify, copy and paste the information it asks for, and the software should be good to run. 

Running
-------
    python navify.py

Questions
-----
**Why does this exists?**
One day I thought it would be great to integrate a Spotify player in my desktops taskbar. I went so far as to make the whole player and get the program to fetch songs when I realized that Spotify wanted me to buy a premium account to stream songs directly to my desktop. After some rough work arounds, I decided that since I can already pull the recommended songs, I should be able to play them through Youtube, and sure enough it worked.

**Why not have an option to stream from Spotify?**
Though the player was supposed to only stream from Spotify, I'm too lazy to purchase a premimum membership and try. Maybe one day I will add the option.
