# Navify
A music streaming software for Linux that uses Spotify's recommendations and streams it from Youtube. Streamed songs are then cached on the users PC for future access. Keep in mind, when a new song is added, Navify uses the **First** video that shows up on youtube when you search for the song and the artist. You may receive videos unrelated to the songs or of bad quality if the song is obscure.

Requirements
------------
- MPV
- Youtube-dl
- Python3
- Socat
- Spotify developer app - must be setup by the user (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/#:~:text=To%20do%20that%2C%20simply%20sign%20up%20at%20www.spotify.com.,complete%20your%20account%20set%20up.%20Register%20Your%20Application)

Installation and Running
------------------------
```
git clone https://github.com/mckset/Navify.git
./navify
```

Usage
-----
- The '+' button adds a song
- The folder button adds a playlist
- the magnifying glass searches for a cached song
- The pencil edits a song (both cached and local)
- The 'N' button searches for recommended songs
- The  '...' opens the settings

Notes
-----
Navify creates and looks for files from the directory it is accessed from. If the program is accessed from a different folder than where the program is located, it will create and expect files like the 'icons' folder to be in that location. 

Updates
-------
- Added option to change font and font size (Webdings is supported I guess)
- Added option to change the local music path
- Added check to "resync" with playing songs left playing after the player crashes (Even though it shouldn't, it's just in case it does)
- Changed the way the player handles played events to be a bit faster (Still relies on internet speed for the most part)
- Fixed previous button not not playing the previous song when shuffle is turned on
- Fixed non-english characters crashing the player when adding songs (All languages have not been checked yet)
- Fixed songs with 10 seconds at the end of the time being shown as X:010
- Fixed playlist not properly listing or playing local songs and locally cached songs 
- Fixed player crashing when attempting to search Spotify for a song with a blank input
- Fixed problem where the recommended button could be pushed more than once, overriding the previous results
- Fixed player crashes leaving songs still playing
- Fixed not all text changing with theme color

Potential Updates
-----------------
- Support to stream from Spotify
- Windows support (maybe some day)
- Local search
- Pre-caching liked songs
- Scrolling text for the 'Now Playing:' area
- Getting Spotify's discover weekly playlist

Known Issues
------------
- Songs with longer names resize certain windows past the display size
- The main window freezes when a subwindow is opened, but continues when the window is closed (Prevents the player from going to the next song in the queue when open)
